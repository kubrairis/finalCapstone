# Final Capstone Project - Task Management System

## Introduction

Welcome to the Lists, Functions, and String Handling Capstone Project! Congratulations for making it this far! This Capstone is a milestone in your learning. This project will consolidate the knowledge that you've learned across various tasks. In this project, you'll be tasked with a set of criteria to meet, but the rest is up to you! Remember, it is worth putting some extra time and effort into this project â€” it can become part of your developer portfolio.

## Developer Portfolio

Developers who have the edge are those who find ways to apply their newfound skills from the get-go. A developer portfolio (a collection of online creations that you have made) allows you to demonstrate your skills rather than just telling people about them. It's a way of bringing your CV to life and introducing yourself to the world. As you learn more skills and put these into practice, each project that you complete will become more efficient and eye-catching.

This application series offers you the means to create projects for your very own developer portfolio, allowing you to walk away from this course not only with a certificate but, more importantly, with a head start into your career!

## The Task at Hand

In this project, you will use lists or dictionaries and functions to extend the functionality of a simple task management system. This is a program designed for a small business to help it manage tasks assigned to each member of a team. This project aims to assess your ability to refactor code. Refactoring code is done to reduce code complexity and ensure the readability of a team's functioning code so that other developers will not struggle to decipher the code.

## Project Description

This task management system allows small businesses to efficiently manage tasks assigned to team members. The system provides functionalities for user registration, task assignment, task tracking, and generating reports. By using lists or dictionaries and functions, the code is refactored to ensure readability and code reusability.
